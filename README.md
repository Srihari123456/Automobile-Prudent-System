# Automobile-Prudent-System
 Safety within automobiles is an aspect that can never be guaranteed no matter how sophisticated and advanced
their core design is. This is an extremely vital problem that can be categorized as large-scale primarily because the number
of automobiles plying on the road currently is massive and the numbers are expected to grow rampantly in the future. The
pivotal reasons that deteriorate safety and increase the fatalities to accidents ratio are over speeding, driving distraction
due to usage of mobiles, unconscious driving, defying safety rules, lack of prompt medical attention, etc. To come around
all these, we have designed a system that allows only a sober driver who wears his helmet/seat belt to start the vehicle and
once he does, the vehicle is being constantly monitored throughout the journey and the rider’s acquaintances can be updated
of the same through an interactive application. Rider’s calls are being intercepted all through the journey and he is blocked
from attending them post which he is prompted to bring the vehicle to a halt, to attend the call. 
This is achieved using a callinterceptor module which uses Bluetooth technology and has a speaker in-built. The driver is also continuously notified
whenever his speed crosses the accepted limit. Additionally, an injured driver lying on the road is forwarded to the right
medical support within the stipulated time by informing his location to the emergency helpline workers. The application
also fills the gap between the driver and the service provider by providing a multitude of service options so that the process
of vehicle service doesn’t get tedious.
