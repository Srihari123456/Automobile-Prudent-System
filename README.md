# Automobile-Prudent-System
21st century can be infamously described as the era of road accidents and the number of causalities
are rising at a dangerously alarming rate. Our project focusses on tackling this very issue by
attacking it at its grassroots level. We propose a system that mandates the driver/cabbie to adhere to
the basic safety measures i.e, a system that compels the drive to wear the helmet/seatbelt in order to
get the vehicle on the go. Our system works based on the collaboration of a number of sensors and a
meticulously designed circuit which is integrated with an interactive easy-to-use application. The
crux of our proposal is to reduce the exorbitantly high ratio of causalities to accidents by
performing a timely emergency act. The system is crafted in a sophisticated manner in order to cater
to the requirements of both two-wheelers and four-wheelers. It enables the user to stay connected
with his acquaintances at any point of time during his journey.
